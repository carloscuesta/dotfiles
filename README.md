# Carlos Cuesta's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, I will be making changes and maintaining the repo as I found interesting stuff to add it.

## Setup 

I’ve made a script to make the setup process easy. 

Copy this command into the terminal, and the setup will start.

`git clone https://github.com/carloscuesta/dotfiles && cd dotfiles && ./osx.sh`

And that’s all! :thumbsup:

The setup process will : 

* Set up OS X computer info (ComputerName, HostName, LocalHostName).
* Set custom OS X preferences.
* Set ZSH shell and [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
	* Customize ZSH with Oh-My-Zsh.
* Install the .dotfiles (aliases, functions, exports, extra, zshconfig, gitconfig).
* Install Xcode Command Line Tools (vcs’s like git and compilers).
* Help you to start with setup of Git.

The **dotfiles** will be stored on a folder called `~/.dotfiles/` in your home directory and the **ZSH files** at `~/` (**ZSH themes** `./oh-my-zsh/themes/`)
